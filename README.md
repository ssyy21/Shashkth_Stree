**The problem Shashkth Stree solves.**

Women often endure mental abuse, emotional instability, and a lack of awareness about their own consent and boundaries. 
Many become victims of cyberbullying and struggle with stress management without realizing the depth of their situation.
Even those who are aware may not know how severe their condition is, what steps to take, or whom to approach for help. 
They are often left questioning—Will someone support me? Do I have a voice? Will my story be heard?

**The Solution**

Shakshat Stree is a comprehensive platform designed to raise awareness and provide actionable support for women facing these challenges. Our interactive quiz section helps women assess their mental and 
emotional well-being through detailed psychology-based and case study questions. The platform offers a thorough analysis of results, guiding users towards necessary actions—ranging from therapy resources to
legal contacts and NGO support. 
Additionally, we facilitate fundraising for women and children-centric NGOs and offer a "Contact Us" feature where women can share their experiences, ensuring that no one feels unheard.
